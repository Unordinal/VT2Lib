# VT2Lib

A re-development of VT2AssetLib (that's not confusing at all). Heavily WIP, but the capability to read binary resources from bundles is implemented along with progress in figuring out the `.unit` resource format, among others. There's quite a few miscellaneous classes that aren't really relevant and/or are broken, so don't assume anything works without testing first.
